Liberals say we should end employment discrimination. I say we should end employment. Conservatives support right-to-work laws. Following Karl Marx's wayward son-in-law Paul Lafargue, I support the right to be lazy. Leftists favor full employment. Like the surrealists – except that I'm not kidding – I favor full unemployment. Trotskyists agitate for permanent revolution. I agitate for permanent revelry.
