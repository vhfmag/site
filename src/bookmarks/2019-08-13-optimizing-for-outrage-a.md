> Is it because I click on questions that sound bananas according to Quora’s algorithms so they show me more outrageous things each week? Or is it because people are getting paid to make highly engaging questions that set people off? I can’t tell, but it feels like the service is measurably worse, since all Quora wants to show me are clueless questions from Trump supporters. If you look at the subjects above, it’s almost a form of sealioning as people are “just asking questions” but my weekly digest email feels more like a pit of vipers than ten interesting questions I used to like reading.
