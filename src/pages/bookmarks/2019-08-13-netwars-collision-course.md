Um texto sobre o crescimento do estado policial e a expansão da implementação de tecnologias de vigilância **fora** dos meios digitais.

> What is astonishing about all of this is the timing. One of the key privacy-related objections to building mass surveillance systems is that you do not know who may be in a position to operate them in future or what their motivations will be. So at the very moment that many democratic countries are fretting about the rise of populism and the spread of extremism, those same democratic countries are proposing to put in place a system that extremists who get into power can operate anti-democratic ways. How can they possibly not see this as a serious systemic risk?

Só uma correção: o crescimento do **fascismo**, não apenas populismo. É tempo de se posicionar
