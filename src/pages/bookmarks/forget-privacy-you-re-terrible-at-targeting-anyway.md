O post inteiro √© √≥timo, engra√ßado e informativo. O estado de an√∫ncios, <i lang='en'>trackers</i> e sistemas de recomenda√ß√£o √© deplor√°vel, se n√£o ris√≠vel. Alguns destaques:

> The state of personalized recommendations is surprisingly terrible. At this point, the top recommendation is always a clickbait rage-creating article about movie stars or whatever Trump did or didn't do in the last 6 hours. Or if not an article, then a video or documentary. That's not what I want to read or to watch, but I sometimes get sucked in anyway, and then it's recommendation apocalypse time, because the algorithm now thinks I like reading about Trump, and now everything is Trump. **Never give positive feedback to an AI**.

> This whole ecosystem is amazing. Let's look at online news web sites. Why do they load so slowly nowadays? Trackers. No, not ads - trackers. They only have a few ads, which mostly don't take that long to load. But they have a lot of trackers, because each tracker will pay them a tiny bit of money to be allowed to track each page view.
