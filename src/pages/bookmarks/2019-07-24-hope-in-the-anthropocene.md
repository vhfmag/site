      title: Hope In the Anthropocene

> Only now is the public starting to see that climate alarmism is fully justified. The opening sentence of David Wallace-Wells’s The Uninhabitable Earth sums up the prognosis: ‘It is worse, much worse, than you think.’

Sim, porra. Vai acabar tudo! TUDO:

> A 1.5°C increase on preindustrial temperatures—the preferred target of the Paris climate agreement—will see nearly 5,000,000 km² of permafrost thawed by 2300, half of the world’s population facing a severe heatwave every twenty years, 130 million exposed to severe drought, and an 8% drop in global GDP per capita.

Parece ok? Calma que esse ainda não é o caminho que estamos tomando:

> At 3° of warming, we can expect extended droughts, crop failures, and broad geopolitical breakdown. (...) Many estimates say three degrees is a likely future: the UN World Meteorological Organisation views 3° as a likely minimum increase if today’s trends continue.

Aí vem uma pergunta óbvia:

> Along the way, we will have to tackle one of climate’s thorniest issues: is individual action the key, or should we instead reconfigure the systems that rule us?

RECONFIGURAÇÃO SISTÊMICA. Problema sistêmico, solução sistêmica. Próxima pergunta.

> In this state of emergency, I find some sad, true determination in the words of Kelly Hayes:
>
> _If the end really is only a few decades away, and no human intervention can stop it, then who do you want to be at the end of the world? And what will you say to the people you love, when time runs out? If it comes to that, I plan on being able to tell them I did everything I could._

Fazer tudo o que se pode fazer é exigir respostas sistêmicas, não mudar a estante do supermercado de onde você pega produtos pra estante dos ecológicos e lembrar 1/3 das vezes de colocar o lixo pra reciclar.

Obrigado por vir pra minha TED Talk.
