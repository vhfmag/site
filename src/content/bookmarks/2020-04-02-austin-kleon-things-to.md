> Measure the walls. Count the ribs. Notch the long days.
> Look up for blue sky through the spout. Make small fires
> with the broken hulls of fishing boats. Practice smoke signals.
> Call old friends, and listen for echoes of distant voices.
> Organize your calendar. Dream of the beach. Look each way
> for the dim glow of light. Work on your reports. Review
> each of your life’s ten million choices. Endure moments
> of self-loathing. Find the evidence of those before you.
> Destroy it. Try to be very quiet, and listen for the sound
> of gears and moving water. Listen for the sound of your heart.
> Be thankful that you are here, swallowed with all hope,
> where you can rest and wait. Be nostalgic. Think of all
> the things you did and could have done. Remember
> treading water in the center of the still night sea, your toes
> pointing again and again down, down into the black depths.
