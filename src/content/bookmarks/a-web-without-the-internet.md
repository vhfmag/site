Here, Andrew dives into how to have a internet-less web (read: without men in the middle, inspection and surveillance). It's a rather technical article, that dives into how to use Dat, together with a <abbr title="Bulletin Board System">BBS</abbr>, to build local webs. Related to [Staltz](https://staltz.com)'s ['A plan to rescue the web from the internet'](/bookmarks/rescue-the-web).
