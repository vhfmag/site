A thorough yet brief historical analysis of the discipline of cybernetics, summarizing its main authors from its different waves, recommending further reads along the way. I don't know if it's a Brazil thing, but until I read that article, cybernetic (as an adjective) was, for me, synonimous with virtual, digital, just a fancy way to say that something had anything to do with computers. To my surprise, it is the multidisciplinary study of _complex, adaptative, agent-based systems_, the natural field of study for the globalized world and a subject close to my heart. I won't try to summarize the essay here: it is really worth the read.
